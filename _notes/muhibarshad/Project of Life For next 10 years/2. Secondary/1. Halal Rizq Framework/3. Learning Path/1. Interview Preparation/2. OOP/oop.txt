In oop , data is tightly coupled while in FP data is loosely coupled.

encapsulation hides physical complexity while abstraction hides logical complexity

Abstraction is done to reduce complexity at design level
Encapsulation is done to reduce complexity at implementation level

mutator : setter
accesser : getter

encapsulation achieve by class

encapsulation - implementation hiding
abstraction - information hiding

Virtual inheritance facilitates you to create only one copy of each object even 
if the object appears more than one in the hierarchy.

This pointer holds the address of current object.

Inheritance is a mechanism in which one object acquires all the properties and 
behavior of another object of another class. It represents IS-A relationship. 
It is used for Code Reusability and Method Overriding.

Inheritence ka nqsan: Classes becomes tightly coupled.  Aik class mai change will 
effect change in other class as well.
Association: Classes are not tighly coupled. If you make any changes in the 
class then it would not be affecting the other class as it wont be inheriting 
the properties of the base class

Composition: Strong Bonding
Aggregation: Weak Bonding

Class is a user-defined data type. Class defines the type definition of category
of things. It defines a datatype, but it does not define the data it just specifies
the structure of data. You can create N number of objects from a class.
