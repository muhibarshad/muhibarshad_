- When you do sin , you fall, satan win , its the instant fall , first fall, this a time to give your punch to move down and thought how much powerful your enemy is , that's not the time to sit and give a chance more to your enemy to fire on you and you thinking from which gate He entered , you firstly use your weapons and hit him, if you don't have weapon then escape run , save your life then in spare think from which gate he enter , if you will think about the greatness of his power and you have nothing then you will never win in your war, you have to use your weapons Allah will send Angels and help you , Allah is with your efforts , but never give a second chance to your enemy , you fight with not resisting the thoughts, you have to be like a man , you will fight through the environment , through realizing yourself Allah is watching you , Allah knows what in my heart  ,  through the God consciousness, and through the patience , through the trust on Allah and through joining the good company instantly move away , stop think ponder and run use weapons use your consciousness, that Am i just doing that sin and not fulfilling the command just for some minutes , some hours some days , some weeks, some months, some years, Am i betting my infinite life to this finite life , is not the graveyard full of all those people whom follow thier desire and become slave of thier self , if slavery is in my fate then why not Allah , if its a war of two between me then why not the Allah will win, if the effect of one will remain forever then why not the good one , so wake up for paradise , for heaven for good grave , for hereafter , for Allah who give you all, wake up for to be grateful and fight and face and see Allah is with you man .
- Then do tuabauh with fully accepting i m the Zalim , thats me who did that , accept and learn and do with the full intention that i will never do again , i will never do that sin again , i will never be like not to fulfill Allah command and be aware from prohibited things , i will be patient and more grateful and more submissive and more god conscious.

- Never do it again remind always yourself join good companies , do good deeds 
- After tuabauh dont make yourself to go again, be like a man you promised and always want Allah's mercy
