**Topic:  (Evil Gaze)**

From my childhood, I have always reflected on this matter deeply. Whenever I see a woman, I realize that my intention can fall into one of three categories.

The first is when a person looks at a woman with **lust**, which is clearly forbidden.  
The second is when one looks **without lust**, but with the intention of becoming emotionally attached or falling in love.  
The third is when one looks at women—such as elderly women, very young girls, or those one does not find attractive—and feels neither lust nor emotional attachment.

However, Allah Almighty commands us to **lower our gaze** and **guard our hearts**. The act of looking itself—whether lustful or emotionally driven—affects the heart, even if one does not intend harm.

> **Arabic (Qur’an 24:30–31):**  
> **Translation:**  
> “Tell the believing men to lower their gaze and guard their modesty; that is purer for them. Indeed, Allah is All-Aware of what they do.”

حَدَّثَنَا إِسْمَاعِيلُ بْنُ مُوسَى الْفَزَارِيُّ، أَخْبَرَنَا شَرِيكٌ، عَنْ أَبِي رَبِيعَةَ الإِيَادِيِّ، عَنِ ابْنِ بُرَيْدَةَ، عَنْ أَبِيهِ، قَالَ قَالَ رَسُولُ اللَّهِ صلى الله عليه وسلم لِعَلِيٍّ ‏ "‏ يَا عَلِيُّ لاَ تُتْبِعِ النَّظْرَةَ النَّظْرَةَ فَإِنَّ لَكَ الأُولَى وَلَيْسَتْ لَكَ الآخِرَةُ ‏"‏ ‏.‏

Narrated Buraydah ibn al-Hasib: 
The Prophet (ﷺ) said: to Ali: Do not give a second look, Ali, (because) while you are not to blame for the first, you have no right to the second.

Sunan Abi Dawud 2149
https://sunnah.com/abudawud:2149

Therefore, even if one looks only for a few seconds, believing it harmless, it still leaves a **spiritual mark** on the heart. The heart becomes influenced by what the eyes see, and over time, that weakens one’s connection with Allah.

**Topic: Badnaziri in the Age of the Internet**

Earlier, we discussed three categories of women that a person may look at in real life. However, the most dangerous and widespread form of _badnaziri_ today is connected to **the internet**.

On the internet, a person has complete freedom — there is **no guardian beside him**, no one to stop him from misusing his phone. Even though **the angels are recording his actions**, there is **no physical presence** to prevent him from looking at what Allah has forbidden.

In public places like streets or markets, a person may see a few women — maybe five, ten, or a hundred. But on the internet, the access is limitless. A person can see the images of **millions, even billions of women** with just a few clicks.

What’s even more dangerous is that these are not only **real women** — the internet now contains **AI-generated images**, which are not from the past, not from the present, and not even real in the future. These images are **artificial illusions**, but they still trigger the same sinful desires and corrupt the heart in the same way.

In this digital age, _badnaziri_ has taken a new form — one that is hidden, private, and more harmful to the soul because it isolates a person from Allah while making sin easily accessible.

**Topic: Controlling Badnaziri and Strengthening the Heart**

We can categorize women into **two main groups**:

1. **Women who exist in public places** — on the streets, in markets, or around us. We can see them with our eyes, and they are present in reality.
    
2. **Women who do not exist physically** — not because they are imaginary, but because we **do not have direct access to them**. These are the women we see online through mobile phones, Facebook, Instagram, or other platforms. The most dangerous of these are **AI-generated images** in cartoons, anime, or digital content, which exist only virtually.
    

The key question is: **How can we strengthen ourselves to avoid sin and protect our hearts?**  
Whether we are in public or private, how can we **restrain ourselves from actions forbidden by Allah** and avoid His displeasure?

We face several challenges:

1. **Our own desires** — as sinners, we have natural inclinations.
    
2. **Satan’s influence** — constantly whispering and encouraging sinful thoughts.
    
3. **Our environment** — social and digital surroundings that push us toward temptation.
    

So the question remains: **How can we protect ourselves and guard our hearts from these influences?**

**Topic: Interaction with Women in Public Spaces**

We are currently discussing the **first category** of women — those we encounter in public spaces. Interactions with women in this category can take several forms:

1. **Passing Glances (Eye Contact):**  
    For example, when walking on the street and a woman walks toward you, the interaction is usually limited to a brief glance or noticing her presence.
    
2. **Service Interactions:**  
    This occurs when you have a task, such as going to a pizza shop or a bank, where the receptionist, cashier, or waiter is a woman. It is important to know how to interact respectfully and appropriately in such situations.
    
3. **Workplace Interactions:**  
    At work, women may be colleagues, managers, or interviewers. Interacting with them requires professionalism, maintaining respect, and following the commands of Allah in speech, behavior, and gaze.
    
4. **Business or Project Partners:**  
    When you work with a woman on a project or business partnership, you need to collaborate respectfully while avoiding anything that may lead to sinful thoughts or behaviors.
    

In all these situations, the goal is to **interact properly without engaging in lust or unnecessary attachment**, keeping the heart protected and obeying Allah’s commands.
**Topic: Applying Love, Lust, and Neutrality in Public Interactions**

We are now applying the concepts of **love, lust, and nothing** to each type of interaction in public places.

1. **Passing Glances (Eye Contact):**  
    For example, when walking on the street and a woman walks toward you, the interaction is usually limited to a brief glance or noticing her presence.
    

The essence of this situation is understanding **how you behave when you see a woman approaching**. Allah Almighty observes how His servant reacts in every situation because He is the Creator of all circumstances.

If you see a woman who is very beautiful, perhaps with golden eyes, and your heart is affected by just one glance, you need to **control your gaze and behavior**. The heart may feel attracted, but the action must remain obedient to Allah.

The Prophet Muhammad ﷺ said:

> **Hadith (Sahih Muslim 2159):**  
> لَا تُتْبِعِ النَّظْرَةَ النَّظْرَةَ، فَإِنَّ لَكَ الأُولَى وَلَيْسَتْ لَكَ الثَّانِيَةُ  
> _“Do not follow one glance with another, for the first is allowed to you, but the second is not.”_

This hadith teaches that a brief, unavoidable glance may occur, but one must **not intentionally prolong or repeat the look**, because the heart is easily influenced.

In this situation, the key is to **recognize the impact on the heart** and **practice self-restraint**, preventing lust or attachment from developing.

**Topic: The Danger of the Second Glance and Attachment**

Sometimes, a person may **fall in love with a woman** who will never be a part of his life. What happens then? He may feel like _majnoon_ (overwhelmed with obsession), constantly thinking about her.

Time, thoughts, and energy are wasted — speaking about her, searching for her, wanting to hear from her, or trying to see her again. In today’s world, with the **internet and unlimited communication tools**, one may attempt to access her online repeatedly.

This leads to **emotional investment**. The more one thinks, searches, and interacts—even virtually—the stronger the **attachment** becomes. Eventually, it becomes very difficult to detach oneself and return to a normal, balanced life.

All of this can happen **just because of the second glance**.

The Prophet Muhammad ﷺ warned us:

> **Hadith (Sahih Muslim 2159):**  
> لَا تُتْبِعِ النَّظْرَةَ النَّظْرَةَ، فَإِنَّ لَكَ الأُولَى وَلَيْسَتْ لَكَ الثَّانِيَةُ  
> _“Do not follow one glance with another, for the first is allowed to you, but the second is not.”_

Allah Almighty also commands:

> **Qur’an (Surah An-Nur 24:30)**  
> _“Tell the believing men to lower their gaze and guard their modesty; that is purer for them. Indeed, Allah is All-Aware of what they do.”_

Why is this guidance so important? Allah, the Creator of all, knows **what benefits His servants and what harms them**. Following these commands protects our hearts, minds, and lives from unnecessary obsession and sin.
It is very important for a person to consider **to whom and to what they invest their heart and love**. Often, we do not know in advance where attachment will lead us and whether it will be beneficial.

This is why Allah Almighty warns us. Allah, the Creator of everything, knows what is truly good for His servants. He is the **Creator of attachment, love, and all emotions**, and He knows where our hearts should rightly be directed.

Whenever our hearts feel attachment — the sensations, excitement, or even “goosebumps” — we must **pause and reflect**: Is this attachment good for me? Is it beneficial, or could it be harmful?

If we attach ourselves to something that is **not beneficial**, it can lead to negative consequences — not only for ourselves but also for our families, partners, children, environment, and responsibilities. Emotional misattachment can make it **difficult to maintain proper relationships** and priorities because the heart is preoccupied with something that does not belong to it.

In this world, improper attachment can therefore lead to a chain of difficulties, affecting every aspect of life — personal, social, and spiritual. This is why self-restraint and reflection are essential whenever our hearts feel drawn to something.

So the most important point here is that whenever we see a woman in public, if we feel love toward her, it will open the doors of destruction for us. It will open the doors of attachment, disobedience, and the displeasure of Allah Almighty.

Because when you fall in love with a girl, you start listening to songs and poetry, you chase her, and you try to get her. When you fail, your mind becomes filled with insecurity and detachment, and your heart cannot bear the pain of losing her. Then you say, “Life is not about being together with her; life is about getting her.”

So, my opinion for you is that whenever you see a woman, you must lower your gaze. It does not matter what her age is because a person can fall in love with anyone — from a child to a woman of 50 or 60 years — as we never know at what age our heart might feel attraction.

The solution is that whenever we are in the streets or public places and we see a woman, we should lower our gaze and avoid looking at her.

One important point here is that when you walk in the streets or go into public places, try to keep your gaze low. Because when you look around — left and right — you see posters, banners, and advertisements showing women, and your heart becomes influenced by these images.

Also, whenever you see a woman walking nearby or a girl with beautiful hair and glowing eyes, even if she looks very attractive, you must lower your gaze. You must not look because this is a **protection for your heart**.

You must also keep in mind that this is a **command of Allah Almighty**. When you do this, Allah will be pleased with you. Remember, Allah Almighty is watching you — how can you look at her knowingly? It is also the **command of the Prophet ﷺ**, and Allah knows what is in your heart.

In this category, our main focus is the _physical woman_, because whenever you see a woman — whether she is your cousin, your colleague, your project partner, a random girl walking in the street, your teacher, or any woman who is not among those whom Allah Almighty has allowed you to see — you are in danger. You are unsafe; your heart and chastity are unsafe.

We are living in an environment where these things have become very common. People who actually understand that this is a serious matter are very few. Those who recognize its seriousness are often labeled as extremists or overly restricted people in Islam. But the truth is, this is a very serious issue that we are not taking seriously enough. Our generations, our children, and our societies are standing at the edge of chaos just because we are not giving this matter the attention it deserves.

The point here is that whenever you see a woman — in the street, in public places, or in your apartment — it is a red flag for you. It is a warning: it’s Satan, it’s your nafs, it’s the environment around you that will try to pull you towards sin.

And here’s another important point: when you see a woman in hijab or abaya, you might think it is permissible to look because she is covered. But you do not understand the tricks of Satan. You do not know his paths and the strategies he uses against you. He will make you imagine in your mind how she looks inside the abaya. Satan is _zalim_, and he wants to make you _zalim_ as well.

Whenever you wrong yourself — by following your desires or letting your thoughts go astray — you are also a _zalim_, and you become a brother of Satan. Allah Almighty has made _maloon_ (cursed) those who are _zalim_, the wrongdoers.

So, the conclusion here is that whenever you see a woman — any woman, in any place, of any type — you have to lower your gaze. You have to move towards Allah Almighty. You must not look at her, not even a single glance. You have to control and suppress your _nafs_. You must remind yourself: _Allah is watching me, my Lord is watching me, my Lord is with me, my Lord knows what is in my heart, my Lord knows what I do, my Lord knows what I have to do, my Lord knows my intentions, my Lord knows what will happen if I see her — my Lord knows everything._

There is no sin that is minor or major — sin is sin. You have to make your heart firm upon this belief.

Now, the next important point is this: when Satan fails to make you look at a woman, he takes his second step. He will whisper to you, saying: _“Just look a little; she is not even pretty, she has no features that will make you fall in love, she is older, she is not attractive.”_

But you have to think: _I have no concern whether she is beautiful or not. I have no concern if she has features that make people fall in love or feel lust. My concern is with the commands of Allah Almighty. My concern is with what our Prophet ﷺ said. My concern is with what my Lord commands me to do._

So, I must only care about what Allah Almighty wants from me. I have to lower my gaze and guard my chastity, as Allah Almighty has commanded.

And the last point I want to discuss here is this: when you succeed in all these things — when you lower your gaze, turn towards Allah Almighty, avoid falling in love or feeling lust — even if a lustful thought comes but you still restrain yourself and do not look at her — Satan will then come again and say: _“Wow! Look at you, brother. How beautiful, how obedient a servant of your Lord you are. You are more superior than these people who look at women with lust.”_

He will make you feel superior. He will try to plant arrogance in your heart — the same weapon he used when he said, _“I am superior to humans.”_

So, what should you say? You must say: _“This is from Allah Almighty. This is the Fazl, the Rahmat of Allah Almighty bestowed upon me.”_

Then Satan will again whisper: _“Your knowledge saved you. Your heart, your knowledge, your intentions saved you.”_ But you must again say: _“This is all from Allah Almighty. All khair is from Allah Almighty.”_

You have to do everything for the sake of Allah Almighty — not for people to call you Mufti, Molvi, or a person close to Allah. These are meaningless words. All praise belongs to Allah Almighty. Everything happens because of Allah Almighty.

So, you must do everything only for Allah Almighty — not for yourself, not for fame — because you are in this world only to fulfill the commands of Allah Almighty and to be submissive to Him.

When you see a woman on the phone, you are seeing the beauty of a woman who actually does not exist. You are not seeing the real beauty that exists in reality. So, your attraction is toward a hypothetical, delusional image that does not exist.

This is why your mind will try to chase these images in real life. But when you actually go to interact with a real woman, you will not feel the same feelings that you felt on the internet or when you saw a woman on your phone.

This opens the doors to mental masturbation and physical masturbation. It also affects your mind’s clarity and strength — your mind becomes overwhelmed, and you will struggle to control yourself.

Even when you interact with women through messages or text, you often find your thoughts consumed by them.

Actually, brothers, I am telling this to myself as well. Whenever you see a woman on the internet, remind yourself that Allah is watching you. Allah knows what is in our hearts. Allah knows what I am doing. Allah is fully aware of everything, including all the intentions I have.

The main point here is that we are not saying that this attraction or interaction is unnatural. This intention is actually natural. Allah Almighty created these feelings and attachment in human beings. But He restricted them to the proper paths through the ways of Allah Almighty.

These feelings come from Allah Almighty, so we must use them in the name of Allah Almighty. If they are used without His guidance or without His presence, they will become a source of destruction for us.

The point I want to discuss is that we should be aware of the poisons of the internet. We should understand the potential hell and destruction that can come from using the phone improperly. This phone is not only a gateway to knowledge, ease, and good things, but it is also a gateway to hell and destructive habits — things we cannot even imagine.

My advice is that whenever you see a woman on the phone, avoid social media platforms, because these platforms will not help you. Gain knowledge from books. Read books. Detox your mind. Do not engage in endless scrolling, and avoid websites that trigger lustful thoughts.

Every picture you see on these platforms creates an image in your mind and triggers your thoughts about them. You must protect your mind from these things. You must save your mind from what can destroy it, because these influences will enter your _self_ and affect you deeply.

So, in a nutshell, the conclusion we have drawn from all the discussions of this topic is as follows: if I were to write every detail of this discussion, my mind would be overwhelmed, and you might not fully understand the disadvantages of seeing women.

Whenever you see a woman — in public or in private, of any type or age — and you feel any intention toward her, whether it is lust, attachment, or any other feeling, you must be strong, patient, and steadfast. You have to remind your heart and mind that Allah is watching you.

You do not have to get attached to her, text her, search for her, chase her, or even look at her. All of this should be for the sake of Allah Almighty alone. Allah is watching you, and He has prepared Jannah for you. The rewards of Jannah and the pleasures therein are also watching you. Think about what will happen if you betray that trust for mere milliseconds of pleasure or temporary deception. You could destroy yourself spiritually and morally.

It all depends on you, brother. Allah Almighty gives you the power to choose between right and wrong. For the next 20 to 30 years of your life, you must be patient, control yourself, and trust in Allah Almighty. Maintain _taqwa_ and fulfill the commands of Allah according to the guidance of Prophet Muhammad ﷺ.

Insha’Allah, if you do this, you will attain Jannah and its pleasures. Allah Almighty will bless you abundantly.

### **Controlling the Heart and Gaze Towards Women**

#### Introduction

From childhood, we experience different feelings when we see women. These can be categorized into three main types:

1. **Lust:** When a woman’s beauty or features attract you, creating desire.
    
2. **Attachment or love:** When you feel emotionally drawn or attached to her.
    
3. **Neutral:** When you neither feel lust nor attachment, often in cases where the woman is very young, very old, or lacks features that attract you.
    

The main lesson from Islam is that regardless of the category, **our gaze and intentions must always be controlled**, because Allah Almighty is always aware of what is in our hearts.

---

#### Women in Public Places

When interacting with women in public places — on the street, in shops, at work, or in offices — there are different types of interactions:

1. **Passing glances:** For example, when a woman walks toward you in the street. Even a single glance can affect the heart if not controlled.
    
2. **Functional interactions:** Interacting with female colleagues, managers, receptionists, teachers, or partners in projects.
    

**Islamic guidance:**

- **Lower your gaze:** Allah commands us to lower our gaze to protect our hearts and chastity.
    
- **Avoid attachment:** Do not fall in love or develop lustful feelings, even temporarily.
    
- **Guard your heart:** Treat every interaction as a test from Allah, observing your behavior with full consciousness of His presence.
    

**Key point:** Even a “second glance” can lead to attachment, wasted thoughts, and desires that are harmful spiritually and socially. These fleeting feelings may seem harmless but can escalate into obsession, wasted energy, and disobedience toward Allah.

---

#### Women on the Internet and Social Media

The dangers increase exponentially online because:

- On the internet, there is **unlimited access** to images of women — real, staged, or AI-generated.
    
- Many of these women **do not exist in reality**; attraction is toward illusions, not actual human beings.
    
- This leads to **hypothetical desires**, fantasies, and mental distractions that cannot be fulfilled, opening the doors to masturbation, lust, and mental turmoil.
    

**Guidance:**

- Remind yourself: _“Allah is watching me. He knows my intentions and my heart.”_
    
- Avoid social media platforms that trigger lustful thoughts.
    
- Focus on reading books and gaining knowledge rather than scrolling endlessly.
    
- Protect your mind from images and content that can plant desires and fantasies.
    

**Summary:** The internet amplifies the natural human desire but removes the boundaries set by Allah, leading to spiritual and mental harm.

---

#### Understanding Natural Feelings and Their Proper Use

It is natural to feel attraction. Allah created these feelings so that men and women can be drawn to each other and continue the human race through marriage. However:

- These feelings must be expressed **within the limits set by Allah**.
    
- Using them outside Allah’s guidance leads to destruction — spiritual, mental, and social.
    

**Practical advice:** Always remind yourself: _“This desire is from Allah, and it should only be used with His guidance.”_

---

#### Patience, Taqwa, and Self-Control

Whenever you see a woman:

1. Lower your gaze.
    
2. Suppress your _nafs_ and control your thoughts.
    
3. Say to yourself: _“Allah is watching me. I must act according to His commands. I will not chase her, text her, or get attached to her. All my actions are for Allah alone.”_
    

Even when tempted to glance at a woman who seems “harmless” or “not attractive,” remind yourself that **your concern is only with obeying Allah, not your desires or imaginations**.

---

#### Rewards of Self-Control

When you succeed in controlling your gaze, avoiding lust, and guarding your heart:

- Allah recognizes your obedience and rewards you.
    
- You become spiritually stronger than those who indulge in lust or attachment.
    
- All success and knowledge are from Allah, and you must remain humble, acknowledging that all _khair_ comes from Him.
    

---

#### Conclusion and Summary

1. **Control your gaze:** Whether in public, private, or online.
    
2. **Avoid lust and attachment:** These lead to destruction of your heart, mind, and social life.
    
3. **Be aware of the internet:** Online images and social media amplify desires for things that do not exist, increasing spiritual risk.
    
4. **Trust in Allah and maintain _taqwa_:** Obeying Allah and the guidance of Prophet Muhammad ﷺ brings long-term benefit and protection.
    
5. **Act for Allah alone:** Do not seek praise from people. All actions should be solely for Allah Almighty.
    

**In essence:** By practicing patience, self-control, and obedience to Allah, you protect your heart, mind, and soul. You fulfill the commands of Allah Almighty and are promised success in this life and the Hereafter.

---

✅ **Final Takeaway:**

- Seeing women is natural; lust and love are natural; but **obedience to Allah must guide all actions**.
    
- **Lower your gaze, guard your heart, avoid the traps of the internet, and act solely for Allah.**
