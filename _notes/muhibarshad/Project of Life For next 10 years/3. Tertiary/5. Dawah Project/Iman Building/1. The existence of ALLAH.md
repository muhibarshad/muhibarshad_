One thing we can all observe and agree upon is that the universe exhibits order, stability, and uniformity. It is precisely structured in a way that allows life to exist within it. From the smallest atom to the largest celestial bodies, we witness an extraordinary sense of purpose and direction within the cosmos. This observation naturally leads us to ask: what is the best explanation for this remarkable order?

Is it the result of a source of knowledge, or is it the outcome of mere chance and absence of intelligence? This is a question that demands careful reflection.

Another question arises: could something come from nothing? Is it conceivable, rational, or plausible that the universe emerged from nothing? Could it have created or caused itself? To suggest that the universe caused itself is akin to claiming that a mother gave birth to herself. Similarly, to propose the existence of multiple ultimate sources of being—multiple necessary existences—is comparable to asserting that a single soul could have more than one mother.

Thus, it becomes evident that monotheism—the belief in a single ultimate source, the foundation of all existence—is the most reasonable conclusion.

The next question we must ask is: what is the purpose of life? Imagine entering a workplace where you do not know who your boss is, what your role entails, or what your duties are. Life, without understanding its purpose, resembles such confusion.

The purpose of life is to align the finite with the infinite. It is to submit to the ultimate Lawgiver, the source of all creation. This is why prophets and messengers were sent across time—Abraham, Moses, Jesus, and, for us, the final prophet Muhammad (peace be upon him). They came to teach humanity this fundamental truth: to submit to God.

Each prophet brought evidence to support their prophethood. In the case of Prophet Muhammad, his evidence lies in the preservation of his message. The Quran has been preserved in a way unparalleled by any other ancient text. Within it, there is a falsification challenge, inviting humanity to find contradictions or to produce a chapter comparable to it.

Furthermore, the Prophet made precise and frequent predictions unmatched by any other historical figure. For instance, he foretold that the Roman and Persian Empires would fall to the Muslims. Barnaby Rogerson, a non-Muslim historian, remarked that imagining the Arabs at that time conquering the Roman and Persian Empires is akin to imagining the Eskimos taking over Russia and America. This illustrates the extraordinary nature of such predictions.know who your boss is, what your role entails, or what your duties are.

One thing we can all observe and agree upon is that the universe exhibits **order, stability, uniformity, and structure**. From the smallest atom to the largest celestial bodies, everything follows precise patterns and laws that allow life to exist. This regularity and direction in the cosmos naturally lead to an important question: _What is the best explanation for this remarkable order?_

Could it all be the outcome of mere chance, without any intelligence or purpose? Or does it point to a conscious, knowledgeable source? Can something come from nothing, or could the universe have created or caused itself? To suggest that the universe caused itself is as absurd as claiming that a mother gave birth to herself. Similarly, to propose multiple ultimate sources of existence is like saying a single soul could have more than one mother — logically impossible.

Everything we see in the world — a pen, a tree, a laptop, even a sock or belt — **does not exist independently**. It depends on something else to exist. Soil, water, and sunlight cause a tree to grow; the tree itself cannot exist without them. These things are **contingent**, meaning they could either exist or not exist. If everything were contingent and dependent, there must be **one necessary being**, independent and self-sufficient, on which all else depends. This is Allah, the eternal, self-existing, all-sufficient Creator.

When we trace causality backward — the causes of causes — we eventually encounter **infinite regress**, which provides no ultimate explanation. There must therefore be a **first, uncaused cause**, the Master Cause who brings all contingent things into existence but is not caused by anything else.

Beyond mere existence, the universe demonstrates **intelligence, information, and purpose**. Look at DNA: it carries immense information that determines life processes. Look at benzene rings: six carbon atoms forming exact bonds, not randomly, but following precise rules. The sun rises and sets on time; celestial bodies move in harmony. **Information always implies intelligence**, and purpose always implies a Planner. Everything from molecules to galaxies is aligned with a purpose, so why would humans, who recognize purpose, exist without a purpose themselves? There must be an ultimate intelligence, all-knowing and all-wise, behind the creation of the universe.

Even morality points to God. While humans may have subjective opinions about right and wrong, there exists **objective morality**, a universal sense of justice and ethical truth. Acts like murder or injustice are wrong not because humans say so, but because morality has an absolute source. The existence of moral law implies a **Moral Lawgiver**, the one who establishes justice and defines ethical truths.

Thus, when we combine these reflections:

1. **Contingency** shows that all things depend on a necessary being.
    
2. **Causality** shows that everything that exists requires a first uncaused cause.
    
3. **Order, information, and design** reveal intelligence behind creation.
    
4. **Purpose** is evident in every object, process, and life itself.
    
5. **Objective morality** points to a Lawgiver beyond human subjectivity.
    

All of these observations converge to a single, unavoidable conclusion: there exists **one ultimate, necessary, intelligent, purposeful, and moral Being — Allah**, the source of all creation, knowledge, and law. Rejecting this leads to contradictions in reason, explanation, and morality itself.
