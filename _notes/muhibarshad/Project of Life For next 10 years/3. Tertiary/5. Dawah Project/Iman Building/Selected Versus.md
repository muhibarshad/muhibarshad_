So her Lord accepted her graciously and blessed her with a pleasant upbringing—entrusting her to the care of Zachariah. Whenever Zachariah visited her in the sanctuary, he found her supplied with provisions. He exclaimed, “O Mary! Where did this come from?” She replied, “It is from Allah. Surely Allah provides for whoever He wills without limit.”

فقال رسول الله ﷺ:  
**"عرفتَ فالزم."**

---

## **2. English Translation**

The Messenger of Allah ﷺ said:  
**“How have you awoken, O Ḥārithah?”**

He replied:  
**“I have awoken as a true believer.”**

The Prophet ﷺ said:  
**“Be careful with what you say, for every statement has a reality. So what is the reality of your faith?”**

Ḥārithah replied:

- **“My soul has detached itself from the world.”**
    
- **“I spend my nights awake in worship.”**
    
- **“I fast during the day.”**
    
- **“It is as if I see the Throne of my Lord clearly.”**
    
- **“It is as if I see the people of Paradise visiting one another.”**
    
- **“It is as if I see the people of Hell screaming within it.”**
    

The Prophet ﷺ said:  
**“You have truly understood, so remain steadfast.**

Allah Subhana wa Ta’ala says in the Qur’an about the **sun, the moon, and the stars** that they are all **subjugated to His command**. Allah says: _“To Him belongs the created realm and the command. Blessed is Allah, the Lord of the worlds.”_

What does this mean? Allah **veils His command behind creation**. The sun, the moon, clouds, rain, and every phenomenon appear to act on their own, but **they are a test for believers**. They are means, not independent actors. A believer must **pierce through the veil** and recognize Allah as the ultimate doer. For non-believers, these means provide comfort and familiarity.

### Understanding the “Asbab” (Means)

Our lives are full of **worldly means (asbab)**. We perceive them as causing effects:

- The sun gives light.
    
- Clouds produce rain.
    
- Medicine heals.
    
- Food satisfies hunger.
    

But the truth is that **everything happens by Allah’s command**. Means are only **apparent causes**. They **do not act independently**.

For example, at the time of death, when the angel of death removes the soul:

- The eyes no longer see.
    
- The ears no longer hear.
    
- The body remains, but the soul is gone.
    

Allah says the **soul is from His command**, meaning **seeing, hearing, living — all are by Allah’s will**. The worldly means are just a **veil over divine action**.

### How Allah Operates

Allah operates in three ways:

1. **Through the means:** Allah’s command is veiled behind worldly phenomena, like sun, rain, or food.
    
2. **Without the means:** Allah provides directly without using worldly tools, e.g., giving fruits out of season.
    
3. **Against the means:** Allah overrides natural laws, e.g., Prophet Ibrahim (AS) in the fire, where the fire did not harm him.
    

Hence, the believer **cannot blame or curse the means**. The means are neutral — it is Allah who **places the command into them**.

### Command-Oriented Living

A true believer is **command-oriented, not results-oriented**. Every act — eating, sleeping, working, business, education — should be done **because Allah commanded it**, not for the worldly outcome.

- Eating is not just to satisfy hunger; it’s **to obey Allah**.
    
- Sleeping is not just to rest; it’s **to follow Allah’s command to rejuvenate**.
    
- Business is not to earn money but to **fulfill Allah’s commands**: honesty, mercy, integrity, fairness.
    

Example from business:  
A Sahabi opened a shop to be **easygoing in his dealings** as commanded in Hadith. He accepted returns without dispute. Even if he lost money, he **succeeded in Allah’s command**. Success is measured by **obedience to Allah, not worldly gain**.

### Fixing Intention

The **intention (niyyah)** is crucial. Every act must be for Allah:

- Social media posts, public appearances, work, or education — all should be **done for Allah’s pleasure**, not recognition.
    
- Intentions are **not static**; they must be constantly renewed throughout the day.
    
- Even in distractions, reminders, or recognition from others, the believer should **align the heart with Allah first**.
    

### The Test of Wealth and Means

Wealth, possessions, and opportunities are **tests (fitna)**:

1. **Your heart should not be attached** to the wealth.
    
2. **You must be ready to leave it** if commanded by Allah.
    
3. **You must use it according to Allah’s command**, within halal boundaries.
    

By passing these tests, one remains **grateful, obedient, and protected from worldly distraction**.

### Takeaway

- Allah is **the doer behind everything**, whether through, without, or against the means.
    
- Believers see **every worldly phenomenon as a sign (ayah) of Allah**.
    
- True success is **fulfilling Allah’s commands**, not worldly results.
    
- Every act, intention, and use of means should be **centered on obedience to Allah**
