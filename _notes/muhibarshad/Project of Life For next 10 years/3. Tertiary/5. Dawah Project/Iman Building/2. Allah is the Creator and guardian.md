Allah is the Creator of all things, and He is in charge of everything. This truth challenges one of the greatest illusions humanity often falls into: the illusion of means. Everything we touch, see, or rely upon — from medicine to money — is only a veil over the true Actor: Allah.

Chapter 39, verse 62 states that God is the Creator of all things and has charge of everything. Reflecting on this verse, we understand its context: it was revealed in Mecca, where people believed in idols and forces controlling life — rain gods, war gods, wealth gods. Allah revealed this verse to break that illusion, teaching that He alone creates and governs every detail of existence.

The Arabic structure of the verse emphasizes continuity: Allah is not only the one who created everything in the past; He is continuously creating in the present. Every heartbeat, every breath, every thought is a fresh act of creation by Allah. Moreover, the term “guardian” in the verse carries a deeper meaning: it signifies the One who **takes responsibility for the outcome of every cause**. Allah is the Trustee, Guardian, Disposer of Affairs — the manager, the controller, the executor, the director, the Producer of all that exists. Nothing can act independently; every event unfolds under His command.

Consider the fire: it does not burn by itself; it burns through Allah’s will. Medicine heals not by its chemical properties, but through Allah’s permission. Money provides sustenance not because of its paper value, but because Allah enables it. Everything in this world — every object, process, and event — is like a “stunt double” for divine action. Apparent causes perform their role, but the ultimate power, command, and direction always belong to Allah.

This world can thus be seen as a **divine matrix** — a system designed not to show Allah directly, but to test whether we can perceive Him behind every cause. The real test is whether our hearts stop at the paycheck, the doctor, or the healer, or whether we see through them to Allah, the true source. Every skill, every action, every result originates from Him.

Everything we see manifest in this world is an **ayah**, a sign pointing back to the One who signs it. Just as an artist leaves a signature on every artwork, Allah leaves His mark on every creation. When we recognize Allah behind the apparent causes, the causes themselves lose independent power. Life is no longer random; it becomes sacred, transparent, and infused with divine purpose.

Consciousness precedes matter: before creation, before existence, there was Allah’s command. Just as a wave cannot move independently from the ocean, every event in our lives is a manifestation of Allah’s will. Worship the ocean, not the waves; recognize the Director, not just the actors on the stage.

When this reality becomes clear, life transforms. Randomness fades, and every event, every encounter, every experience begins to point toward a single truth: Allah is the Creator, Sustainer, and Guide of all that exists.

Allah Almighty said in the Qur’an: **“Allahu Khaliqul Shay’in”** — Allah is the Creator of everything. This is not a statement that creation happened once in the past. Rather, it means that **every heartbeat, every breath, every touch, every sight, every feeling, every sound, and every wave of your voice is a fresh act of creation by Allah**. Everything existing in this world — every moment, every particle, every event — is continuously being created by Him.

Allah also said: **“Wahoo Allahu Lishayin Wakeel”** — He is the Trustee, the Guardian, the Disposer of Affairs. He is the One who **manages and governs the outcomes of everything in existence**. Allah does not merely create and leave things to run on their own; He maintains, sustains, and controls every detail of the universe. Every cause, effect, and event occurs under His will and authority.

This means that **nothing in this world happens independently**. The fire burns, the sun rises, medicines heal, and money provides sustenance — all through Allah’s command and permission. He is the **ultimate executor, the director, the Producer of all that exists**, with full control over every atom, every particle, every wave of energy.

Allah is **self-sufficient**. He does not need anything: He does not need your prayers, your worship, your life, or your existence. On the contrary, **you and everything in the universe are entirely dependent on Him** for sustenance, life, and every blessing. He is the Sustainer, the Provider, and the Absolute Source of all that exists.

Understanding this transforms our perspective: **we are entirely dependent, but Allah is completely independent**. Everything we see, feel, and experience is a manifestation of His power, will, and mercy. He is fully in control, and nothing can exist or act without His command.
