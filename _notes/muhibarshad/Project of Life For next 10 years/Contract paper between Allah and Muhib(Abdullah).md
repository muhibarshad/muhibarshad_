My name is Muhib Arshad, and today I stand before Allah Almighty, my Lord, my Rabb, who created me, who made me, who provides me with everything I have, to whom I must return. He is One, and He has no partner. He is self-sufficient.

- I acknowledge that there is no God but Allah, and Muhammad (P.B.U.H) is the last messenger of Allah Almighty.
- I recognize that I must follow the commands of Allah Almighty, obey Him in every part and every breath of my life, and worship Him by following the Sunnah of Prophet Muhammad (S.A.A.W).
- I spent 22 years, 10 months, 28 days, 11 hours, and 26 minutes without following the commands of Allah Almighty.

Today , At 27 minutes I'm doing "Tuba" :

### Confrontation:  
> I accept that everything I did in my life was wrong. I wronged myself; I did injustice to myself. I did not follow the commands of Allah and did not follow the Prophet Muhammad (P.B.U.H). I also acknowledge that I wronged my family and the people connected to me. I committed many sins, even knowingly, while fully conscious of my actions. I sinned, aware that Allah was watching me, my Lord was seeing me. I showed no respect for my Lord who created me. I did things that invoked His punishment. I moved so far from Him that I lost all the faith I once had.
> 
### Repentance :
I ask forgiveness from Allah Almighty. Ya Rabb, forgive me for all that I have done, forgive me for all the wrongs I have done to myself. Kindly forgive me for the things I have committed. Ya Rabb, I have heard from the people that You forgive all sins, that You forgive the sins of the children of Adam. Ya Rabb, I feel immense shame for my actions, I am deeply guilty for the things I have done. I shouldn't have done those things. Ya Allah, I am Your very bad servant. Ya Allah, forgive all my sins. Ya Rabb, I have done so much wrong that no tears come from my eyes. My heart has become blind. Ya Allah, You turn hearts from light to blindness and from blindness to light. Ya Allah, please bring me back to Yourself. Bring back all the faith I once had. Bring back all the light I once had. Ya Allah, bring me back to the Muhib I was at least two years ago.

Ya Allah, kindly forgive me. I know I have done so much and didn't care for the things You gave me. I didn't recognize the value of these blessings in my life. Ya Allah, You know that two years ago, at the same time, I was writing a letter to someone to express all my worst feelings. Now, at the same time, I am writing this to You. Ya Allah, this is Your blessing. I am so grateful to You, Allah, for choosing me to write this. I am very thankful, Ya Allah. Ya Allah, my heart has become blind.
		
		Ya Allah, forgive me, forgive all my sins, and bring me back to Yourself. Bless me with Your mercy, for I am Your servant to whom I will turn and tell all my matters. Ya Rabb, I am a great sinner, but Your blessings and mercy are greater than my sins. Your mercy is more vast than all my wrongdoings. Ya Allah, forgive me and cover me with the mercy of Your Rahmah. Make me Your best servant, the servant who will fulfill and obey Your commands, who will follow the Prophet Muhammad (P.B.U.H), who will choose the right path, and who will not follow his desires and whims 
		Ya Allah, my heart is filled with so much pain that I can't even explain. Please, Ya Allah, bring me back to You. Ya Allah, Shaitan, my desires, and my own self have distracted me so much from the right path. I have made myself filthy and messy. Whenever I sin, I keep telling myself that one day I will repent, but I don't know the cost of all that I've lost. I have lost all the faith I once had, and now I don't know how to truly make Tawbah.
		Ya Allah, I love You, but in reality, I don't truly love You because I am not fulfilling Your commands
