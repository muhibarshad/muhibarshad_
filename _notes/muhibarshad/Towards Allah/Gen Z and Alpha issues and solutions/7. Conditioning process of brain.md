You will love the things you consume. It’s not accidental or unconditional; it's a conditioning process of the brain. For example, if someone consumes content about Ronaldo, they will come to love Ronaldo, and if they consume content about Messi, they will come to love Messi. These figures become their idols through repeated exposure.

Have you ever wondered why you feel such deep devotion to someone? Why do you like that celebrity? Why does someone become your ideal?

For example, why would someone like CR7, even though CR7 doesn’t know whether that person exists or not? Your priorities, interests, devotion, and thoughts depend on the information you consume. If someone first comes across content about Ronaldo, they will begin to like Ronaldo. If someone consumes content about Messi, Messi will become their ideal. But a person who knows nothing about them will never feel devoted to either. It’s a conditioning process of the brain. So, if you don’t know a person and have never consumed any content about them, your brain won’t have the information needed to generate thoughts about them.

When we become devoted to someone, we think about them, remember them, and want to be like them. But the reality is, they don’t know anything about us, and they will never respond to your thoughts or devotion, even on the Day of Judgment. Isn’t this similar to idol worship? These idols may not exist physically, but in our hearts, we have created small idols, and our hearts are deceived by remembering them.

As Allah Almighty says in the Quran:

القرآن - سورۃ نمبر 46 الأحقاف

آیت نمبر 5

وَمَنۡ اَضَلُّ مِمَّنۡ يَّدۡعُوۡا مِنۡ دُوۡنِ اللّٰهِ مَنۡ لَّا يَسۡتَجِيۡبُ لَهٗۤ اِلٰى يَوۡمِ الۡقِيٰمَةِ وَهُمۡ عَنۡ دُعَآئِهِمۡ غٰفِلُوۡنَ ۞

ترجمہ:

اس شخص سے بڑا گمراہ کون ہوگا جو اللہ کو چھوڑ کر ان کو پکارے جو قیامت کے دن تک اس کی پکار کا جواب نہیں دے سکتے، اور جن کو ان کی پکار کی خبر تک نہیں ہے۔
