Justice ⚖️ is one of the greatest pieces of evidence that God exists. If someone dies after enduring so much injustice (zulm), there must be a day when complete justice will be served.

Information requires intelligence; every single piece of information in the world has intelligence behind it. DNA contains vast amounts of information. Where did that information come from? Who provided the intelligence to structure benzene and form six bonds? This indicates the presence of a higher intelligence.

Something comes from something. There is a 0% probability that something can emerge from nothing, even in trillions or billions of years. Possibilities only exist if something already exists. If there is nothing, there can be no possibility of existence. Something can only emerge from nothing if an external force causes it.
