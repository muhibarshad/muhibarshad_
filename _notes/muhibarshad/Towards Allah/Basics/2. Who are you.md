oday, we’re going to talk about **_you_** — yes, **_you_**. Who are you? After that, we’ll explore the entire journey of your life: your self, body, senses, intellect, knowledge, thoughts, memory, sensations, emotions, heart, desires, choices, and even the influence of Satan.

Together, we’ll dive into the deep ocean of *you* — trying to reach the very bottom to see what surfaces. Why is it that, despite all the knowledge and years of effort, your life isn’t changing the way you want? Who are you, really?

This is a story about you and me.

In quran Allah Almight says :

> **It is He — Allah -Who created you from a single being. (7:189)**

It means all humans are created with a shared psyche. If you understand yourself, you can generally understand others too — though not entirely, as everyone’s knowledge and central nervous system are unique.

Let’s take **_Abdullah_** as an example — you, suppose. Abdullah is like an image made up of pixels. Each pixel represents his daily habits and repetitive tasks.

Abdullah is a programmer **_(pixel 1)_** because he codes daily. Abdullah is a smoker **_(pixel 2)_** because he smokes daily. He is a brother **_(pixel 3)_** because he connects with his sibling daily. Abdullah is a teacher **_(pixel 4)_** because he teaches daily. He is a drinker **_(pixel 5)_** because he drinks water daily. Abdullah is a liar **_(pixel 6)_** because he lies daily and go on……….

Suppose these are the pixels of Abdullah image

Whatever Abdullah does regularly becomes a pixel in his image. When all these pixels combine, they form the complete picture of “Abdullah.” From a distance, we see the image as a whole and call it Abdullah. But when we zoom in, we can analyze every pixel in detail, understanding what makes him who he is.

Abdullah’s nature, like every human, comes pre-installed with addiction and submission. When his brain experiences pleasure, it seeks to repeat that pleasure. Similarly, he is submissive to everything necessary for his survival. This means Abdullah cannot eliminate these two traits, but he can use them to improve himself and make his image brighter and clearer.

After taking 8 oaths in Surah Al-sahamas Allah almight said :

> **Successful indeed is the one who purifies their soul (91:9)**

It means, if we remove bad pixels(habits) and add good pixels(habits) in our image(soul).Then we will purify our soul completly. That verse mathematical miracle I see is that chapter no 91 and verse no is 9

91+9=100

and verse is after taking 8 oaths about who will succeed ? A man will complete(succeed) who will purify his soul(means a man will complete here) Walllah Alam .

If Abdullah removes noisy pixels (bad habits) and replaces them with smooth pixels (good habits), his image will become sharper. To make it brighter, he needs to add more smooth pixels — adopting even more good habits.

By combining all the pixels a complete image of Abdullah is forming.

Abdullah also knows he is naturally submissive. For example, if he owns a sweater that looks great but feels itchy, he will still wear it because it looks beautiful. Here, the sweater becomes his master, and he is submissive to it. Similarly, all of Abdullah’s bad habits are his masters because he submits to the pleasure they provide.

If it’s decreed for Abdullah to live and die in submission, why not submit to Allah Almighty? If he doesn’t, he may submit to materialistic desires instead. Either way, he will live and die in submission.

Now it’s time to dive deep into the ocean of **_yourself._** Oh, wait — I just added the word **_self_** with *you*! Who is that? I added it to *you,* and you ignored it, letting me insert anything into your life. Why is that?

What is **_self,_** and why am I attaching it to your pronoun? We’ve explored **_you_\***,\* and now it’s time to understand **_self_** as we begin this journey.As the words say “**_its your-self”_** . Its me, you and everyones self.

S*elf* is made up of three components: **_body, mind, and sensors._** Now you might say, “You’ve broken me into pieces — so, where am I?” If we break a car into parts, the car no longer exists as a whole. Yet, those parts together define what a car is.

![](https://miro.medium.com/v2/resize:fit:700/1*jJFxH-4Q4VomgGC0rws2eg.jpeg)

**_The body_** is purely material and serves two purposes: **_survival and reproduction_**. It has no awareness of being alive or dead — that’s the mind’s job. For example, if you lose a part of your body, you still retain all knowledge about yourself. This shows that intellect has no direct link to the body.

The body desires to live forever, which is why it focuses on survival. When it realizes its mortality, it seeks immortality by reproducing — leaving its mark to live on eternally.

**_The mind_** is bound by a contract with the body: its primary function is to ensure the body stays alive. The mind knows that if the body survives, it survives too.

**_Sensors_** (sight, hearing, taste, smell, touch) act as data collectors. They gather information and send it to the mind. The mind processes this data, compares it with past experiences stored in the subconscious, and makes decisions that will help the body to keep alive , beacuse mind and body both contract that mind will try his best to make body alive , thats why if mind has any past memory or data on which he knows body will get harm or maybe become dead , he never took that decision, we will see that machnism in detail in next section .Both the body and sensors are compelled to obey the mind’s conclusions.

![](https://miro.medium.com/v2/resize:fit:400/1*o63y1JoXLTTr5K4p7lX4kw.jpeg)

Mind is the master.

These three — body, mind, and sensors — are incomplete in the absence of any one component.( Also body needs repeation of its survival task thats why it has addictive nature as we discussed earlier).

Now that we’ve explored **_you and the self_** — or rather, *yourself* — our diving suit is ready. Let’s plunge deeper into the ocean of thoughts, fears, stress, and anxiety…….

Now, let’s suppose Abdullah encounters external tension or a triggering moment — a stimulus, any external failure in life( e.g :..that his mind knows its harmful for his body). This stimulus is what we call a **_thought._** A thought, in its essence, is dead; it has no physical existence. It originates outside, not inside, as it comes from external stimuli.Like quick exam in 2 minutes , its from outside not generated in brain .

If Abdullah focuses on that thought, it becomes **_thinking._** The thought then moves into the **_subconscious memory,_** which holds **_patterns_** connected to similar past experiences. For example, if the external stimulus is “a quick exam in 2 minutes,” the subconscious memory will retrieve patterns associated with exams — like paper, ballpoint, examiner, results, passing, and failing.

The subconscious tries to connect the external thought to its stored memory patterns. **Memory**, in turn, is nothing more than past experiential data. When any thought will attach with emotions it will become the part of subconsious , memory burn into memory cells when emotions attach with that , like any moment whom we feel emotional will ever remain in memory and get be feel back as we memorize that . All these stored patterns of the past are what we call **_memory_\***. All that memories we have called it\* **_knowledge_** \*.\* When that knowledge is further analyzed and utilized, it transforms into **_intellect._**

The mind uses intellect to solve problems, ensuring the body’s survival. It gathers new data from the sensors, matches it with past experiential data, and processes both (burning energy) to generate a decision.

However, in so big world , we grow up in limited environments with little exposure to diverse experiences, our past experiential data remains weak. Similarly, the incoming data from our surroundings may also lack depth. As a result, we operate within a restricted circle, leading to weak decisions. This makes us accidental beings, relying on no authentic foundation for decision-making. Consequently, the decisions we make are often accidental and lack strength.

As Allah Almighty said in the Quran , we give knowedge intellect to man so little.

> **and you ˹O humanity˺ have been given but little knowledge.(17:85)**

Generated results create **_sensations (feelings)_** in the sensors and body, which lead to **_emotions (energy)._** The heart, as the center of emotions, is a pumping organ that constantly requires an energy spark to function. It generates heat, and since our body maintains a temperature, it’s clear that energy is both created and consumed.

This energy comes from emotions. When the brain makes decisions, sensations trigger emotions that travel via neural pathways fromthe mind to heart, supplying energy. At the same time, the brain needs oxygen and nutrients to process more data and connect with patterns stored in the subconscious.

Recognizing the brain’s role in its survival, the body supplies oxygen and nutrients to the brain through blood vessels from he heart pumping to brain . This process causes the body’s energy to be consumed rapidly, accelerating the aging process as resources burn faster.

If we summup the above , In the vicious loop of maintaining repetitions, we encounter more complex stimuli and thoughts. The brain consumes more energy from the body to process this increased data, generating results that sustain the cycle. These results also generate sensations and emotions with every processing, causing the heart to pump harder and consume more energy.

As a result, the heart weakens over time(thats Allah called Hearts corrosion), and it starts pumping faster in response to even the slightest sudden threat — like seeing a snake or any danger that the body associates with death based on past experiences. For instance, the brain recalls the data that “a snake can kill,” prompting it to command the body to move quickly away from the danger. The body, trusting the brain in this contract, obeys without hesitation.

![](https://miro.medium.com/v2/resize:fit:691/1*Mc9vnr8CV1vOf-UDaBNxrQ.jpeg)

Every night, when we sleep, all external stimuli are turned off, and our energy begins to restore. The heart and brain calm down. When we wake up in the morning, our body is fully energized. However, to connect the past with the present, we start by thinking about the things we have to do that day. In striving to maintain our image pixels, we burn all the stored energy in the brain and heart. By the end of the day, we fall asleep, fully exhausted.

Why does Allah Almighty often mention that hearts are blind or that hearts don’t listen? And why is it said that with the remembrance of Allah, hearts find peace? Why do we always greet others with “Assalamu Alaikum” — praying for their peace? The reason is simple: when we remember Allah and submit ourselves to Him, repeating the defined actions He prescribed, He knows that He created us with an addictive nature. That’s why He gave us “Salah” (prayer).

If our image (self) is pure, free from bad addictions and worldly lustful desires, our mind becomes calm and focused on Allah. This allows it to make smooth connections and patterns with little energy consumption, and as a result, the heart becomes calm. When the mind has no conflicting thoughts, energy remains intact, and we can redirect it toward acquiring more knowledge.

As our knowledge grows, both our conscious and subconscious minds become stronger. We begin to perceive things as they truly are, which strengthens our decision-making ability.

And anything about that our brain have no data it also create fear on that because he doesn’t know what will happen ? Thats why he always try to connect past data with current data to generate future insights ? What the silly and foolishness human have , means im pprojecting the psat with little modifications , question yourself are you not today same as 1y ago just with little modifications

Allah Almight said in quran no know the tomorrow .

> **No soul knows what it will earn for tomorrow (31:34)**

So why we are getting stress on past ? thats just a memory with emotions brust , dead no pyhiscal existence and also getting fear about future that doesn’t exist in itslef and just a thought projection of past with just little new data processing.

This is all part of Satan’s game — he understands us deeply. Desire is the driving force behind life, and that’s the truth. When we receive any data and process it, a window of “yes” and “no” is generated in our mind. To do that task or not if we chosse yes any qadar from Allah Almighty have been written in our fate and same for no , This is the only place where Allah Almighty grants us free will, the choice to decide for ourselves. Everything else that happens is part of His Qadar (divine will), onlt that chhoice will is Tadbeer.

![](https://miro.medium.com/v2/resize:fit:276/1*-9JoEI2zu980ym2IYLv_mQ.png)

Such image of yes and no prompt(form) to take choice, humans have only will at that point.(That I say maybe not wallahAlam but maybe a little bit)

> **But you cannot will ˹to do so˺ unless Allah wills.(76:30)**

But on one point Allah Almighty said :

> **and that each person will only have what they endeavoured towards,(53:39)**

At that point, Satan influences us by making sins appear beautiful, attaching whispers (waswasa) that draw us into sin. Sin requires two things: energy and, most importantly, time. If you want to know Allah, do good deeds, and add positive pixels to your life, you need to be free and find time.

Satan’s main goal is to waste our time, which is why he calls us toward sin. By doing so, he ensures we never find time to think or reflect. He then makes us invest all our energy into sin. Once we’re exhausted, he instills hopelessness and fear, showing us our insecurities, and urges us to burn our energy by moving away from Allah, focusing instead on worldly matters.

Satan leads us into bad habits, infecting our brain with “malware” data, which malfunctions the thought process, making it harder to align with good data.

However, if you examine just one pixel of your life daily, accept the good and remove the bad, you will eventually create space. Now new data is needed to replace the bad. By continuing this process throughout your life, InshAllah, one day the entire image will become bright.(purifing soul as said in 91:9).

In the end, the past is dead, the future is dead, and even thoughts about them are dead because thoughts are always about material things, and materials are dead. If a thought from the past arises, stop and remind yourself — it’s a dead thought. Similarly, if you’re tempted by thoughts about the future, stop and recognize that it doesn’t exist.

The only thing that is real is your current body and energy. Don’t waste them on useless things. Instead, observe and increase your knowledge to enhance your energy. Spend that energy in Allah’s remembrance (Zikr) and in adding good pixels to your life.

Everything that has been said doesn’t mean it’s all wrong. It just shows the psychosis and how things work. Now, look upon yourself — you are you. Write down all the bad habits you have. If you are addicted to songs, accept it. Once you accept it, recognize that you are a song listener and have that bad habit. Now, make a plan to remove it. Write down the triggers for this habit, without attaching any extra information about the songs. See the exact activity of listening to songs. Then, write your own treatment plan to overcome it.

Last but not least, this is your story, this is you. You are alone in this game. Never try to make anyone else join you or involve them in your journey. You will go all alone, and even loneliness will not go with you.
