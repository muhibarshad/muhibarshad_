O my Lord, Allah! I looked in every direction—left, right, up, down, back, and front, 360°. I went to every place, I closed my eyes, and I see everything, but I found no one to claim my sufferings to, no one to say "forgive me," no one whom I love unconditionally, no one whom I can never fully discover, and no one who will not resist me.

I have done so much wrong to myself. Forgive me, accept me, and I know You want me to win on the Day of Judgment. That’s why You showed me so many signs. I see You through the eyes of my heart. I know You listen to my sufferings.

Ya Illahi, wa leesa illa rabbi siwa. Ya Allah, if You don’t forgive me, I will destroy myself and become one of the disbelievers. Ya Allah, I am in so much pain. Ya Allah, Your person is about to completely die. Ya Allah, help me! You helped me before, but I rejected, I did wrong. Ya Allah, forgive me and have mercy upon me.

Ya Allah, put me on the truth and straight path, protect me, and open my eyes to see things as they truly are. Increase my knowledge and place the love of You in my heart, so that it supports my knowledge through my actions. I want to see You in Jannah.
