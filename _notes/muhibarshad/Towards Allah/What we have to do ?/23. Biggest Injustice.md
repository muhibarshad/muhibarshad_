Ya Rabbi, I’m a liar in the matter of You. I’m a great liar. Make me truthful, make me one of Your closest ones. I need just You, Your pleasure without any condition. Ya Rabbi, I sold You, I went away from You. Your first response to me was to bring me close to You, but I lost You. I lost everything.

Ya Rabbi, make my actions and words synchronize before I meet You. I want to meet You in such a way that You will say, "My closest servant is coming." Ya Rabbi, I’ve heard from Your servants that You are very merciful. Rabbi, have mercy on me and forgive me, otherwise, I will become one of the zalimeen.

The zalimeen are those who do injustice. The injustice is that they say things that don’t exist, like blaming someone for doing something they didn’t do. The biggest injustice (zulm) in the whole universe is attaching any lie to You, saying that there is another besides You who did something. When we do this, we are committing the greatest injustice with You.

That’s why Ya Rabbi, if You don’t save me and make me closer to You, I will become zalim. Ya Allah, save me. Ya Rabbi, I don’t want to become one of those who will not see You. Ya Rabbi, I want to feel that feeling when I’m coming Your way, knowing that just a few steps away, I will meet You, and You will be pleased with me.
