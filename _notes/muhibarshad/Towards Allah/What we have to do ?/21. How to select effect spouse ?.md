Humans create different instruments and physical measures to judge and differentiate things from each other. For example, they developed the kilogram scale to weigh objects, using it to determine their mass and weight. The list of judging criteria for everything continues to evolve over time. Humans establish two types of standards: universal and local. Universal standards are accepted by everyone, whereas local standards vary depending on individual perspectives.

When it comes to judging other humans, there are no universal standards set. However, big mafias, leaders, and CEOs of companies have created and implanted local standards into the minds of humans. For instance, a man may believe that he has his own standard to judge women, but in reality, makeup and social media companies have influenced his mindset since childhood through cartoons, TV shows, and Netflix series, promoting the idea that he should love or choose a girl based on her physical attractiveness. When a girl realizes that all boys prefer the prettiest face, she looks in the mirror and if she doesn’t feel pretty, she remembers the product she saw in an ad on Instagram, thinking that by using it, she will become a pretty girl and everyone will like her. These influential minds don’t stop there; they collaborate with the influential minds of the software industry. To ensure that she believes she looks pretty using their product, they create filter features to enhance the results. They go even further by implementing features such as likes and comments, allowing you to receive reviews from your social circle as proof that you are attractive. Dopamine is released when your favorite person likes your post, giving you internal satisfaction, and they win in their game. If I were to delve deeper into this topic, this article would turn into a book on how these standards have been embedded in our brains.

From the girls’ side, the same thing happens. They judge boys based on their wealth, status, and beauty as well. Brothers and sisters, I urge you to question yourselves. Are you judging others solely based on their appearance? Did they make their face? Did they make themselves beautiful? Did they make their height? Did they acquire all their wealth from the heavens? If the answer is yes, then you judge a person as good because they have worked hard and built these things for themselves. So why do we judge street persons, university friends, or anyone on social media as good or bad based on these criteria for being a potential spouse?

If they judge spiderman on its appearance, then spiderman is a hero not a prison.

Now the question arises, if all these standards are wrong, what are the correct criteria or standards to judge humans? There is a point where the human brain reaches its limit and the knowledge of Allah Almighty begins. On the occasion of Arafah, the Prophet Muhammad (SAW) said:

> “All mankind is from Adam and Eve. An Arab has no superiority over a non-Arab, nor does a non-Arab have any superiority over an Arab. A white person has no superiority over a black person, nor does a black person have any superiority over a white person except through **piety (taqwa) and good actions**.”

Islam gives us the one true standard to judge others, and all others are wrong. That standard is “**_Taqwa._**” But what does **Taqwa** mean? Taqwa refers to a person who fears Allah. Now you might ask, how can we judge if someone fears Allah or not?

Brothers and sisters, when a person truly loves someone, they are always afraid of making that person angry. They fear doing anything that would bring shame in front of them or jeopardize their relationship. They would do everything in their power to please their loved one, regardless of whether anyone is watching or not. Their love becomes evident to everyone because their entire life revolves around trying to please their loved one. Everyone can witness their love through their words, actions, eyes, ears, and appearance.

Andrew Tate openly tweets about his conversion to Islam and shares his prayer videos without any fear of people; he only fears Allah. After becoming a Muslim, he goes to jail. However, upon his release, he declares that he only reads the Quran and does pushups. In his recent BBC interview, he emphasizes, ‘I am only afraid of Allah; He is the best planner.

**In conclusion**, never judge anyone solely based on their appearance. Judge people based on **_Taqwa_**, the fear of Allah.

JazakAllah brothers and sisters, for reading this. If you agree with my point of view then you would please implement this in your life. Give respect to all peoples, especially those who are lower to you.
