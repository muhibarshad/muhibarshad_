I don't know how long this will go , or dear readers you will read it or not completey its 11:30 PM, because I never wanted to write about it. My self and satan are too scared, thinking that if he reveals it, then all things will go away, because the brain has the nature of moving anything it discovers into norms. But I think I have to do this before I die. I know I'm doing something wrong; I will discuss some things that aren't good, but I will do it to show you what's wrong so you can understand what's right. In the end, inshaAllah, I will pray to Allah to bring the truth from it. My intentions are really not pure, and may Allah unguide me after that. May He ask me on the Day of Judgment, "You sold me just to show what you feel."
So keep in mind one thing: The writer is very bad, involved in many sins, did many wrong things, and is so bad. I haven't applied any of it in my life. I just know, so I am just guiding. It's just a tiny piece of information. The whole ocean is in the 7 billion people, billions of books, and billions of videos about it. Firstly, I will share some of Abdullah experiences to relate to you. If you are also facing such problems or have faced them, inshaAllah, this article will bring peace to your heart.
Firstly, I want to know myself. Who am I? I dive into the ocean of self, reading books and making observations at late hours, just walking and thinking. I just want to know the truth before I die. Otherwise, life will be useless. Time is too short. In my journey, the biggest mountain is love. So, first, I have to tackle it. Let's start and see how we can tackle this blessing or curse.
In 22 years of my life of abdullah, he always moved away from himself, always abused himself. Why do he feel that energy so strongly, always pushing himto remain in pain, always destroying himself? because the love he feel is totally different from what the world shows him; it always brings conflict.
From childhood, he was very sensitive and emotional. If any person spent just a few moments with him, or any place he visited, or any book he read, he felt something so different, something he couldn't put into words. It was so much heart pain, like when he remember that person, or if that person is just nearby, he feel a weird sensation from his neck to his chest and from his heart to my hands. If he close his hands, the heart pain intensifies. His eyes fill with tears, and He feel that person's presence deeply. His biggest wish in those moments is just to sit with that person, say nothing, but just feel their presence.
I've had many other experiences like that. I would go to gardens, spend most of my time with trees, and think about Allah - Who is He? Who am I? Why do I have so many emotions? In every bayan, I always heard the phrase, "Love only for Allah." I didn't even know what Salah was. I saw things in a different way. At home, I would destroy all my toys and make something amazing out of them. I would always look at the stars and have so much curiosity about cosmology. I wasn't doing what people my age would do.
I joined Sufism at the age of 15. I read books and went to my spiritual teacher every month to seek Allah's love. But I wasn't truthful. In reality, I was just searching for the truth. I had so many questions in my mind, a sea of questions, and I couldn't find anyone who would answer them.
I was totally blind. I just followed things wherever I saw any hope of finding a way to reach kaifiat (emotions) with Allah. In reality, I wanted to feel spirituality. I always sought some kind of kaifiat in everything. Like every morning, I would take my cup of tea and watch how the sun rises. My biggest wish was to have a garden in my house with all my favorite trees, and in the evening, before Maghrib, I would sit on my prayer mat and do tasbeeh, while the birds would come with their songs and drink water. Some fresh, cool air would blow, and I would feel peace in that moment.
If I were to write a book about all these experiences, it would be so filled with moments like this. But I always looked at these things as an abuse. Normal people are chilling, playing, and doing different things, while I'm stressed, always crying, and not even understanding what is happening. I never shared this with anyone because I thought they would think I was mad. I didn't have the words to express it.
Spiritual cults never deceived me because whenever I went to follow what they said, my heart told me it wasn't true. I saw people who were spiritual and did such things, but they were weak in shariah, focusing solely on Allah's love while neglecting His commands. On the other hand, I saw ulama who were too strict with shariah, but had no love for Allah.
And in all this, I fell in love with a girl. I just see her soul through my eyes but I was too foolish to realize her . I thought that if I realize her what I am feeling that will become impure some impurity, it would taint me, but I just felt her presence. I even mad I put my feet on that path that she walked. I even collected the soil from her path in a glass jar as a sign of respect. Any word associated with her, I studied it deeply. If I found a piece of paper she had touched, I would grab it and keep it close in my wrist, as if when I touched it, my heart would burst, because she has touched it, i know , if i will open up and she will not see me as I'm , then that day I will die , i Even recorded her voice and I listened to it whenever I feel like to die, whenever I feel like to talk I write it in my diary,i m so mad if she just move her hand and if accidentally i see it my heart go to neck, butbut but I would go to the mosque and sit, praying to Allah about her, crying until my shirt was drenched in tears, and the prayer mat was soaked.
I left everything in Allah's hands on that day. During vacations, I asked my parents if I could go to a madrassa for a few months to study deeply. They said, "If you go, don't come back." They thought these people were extremists and would misguide me. I cried a lot on the stairs, with my family watching, but no one came to say, "are you okay?"
But I went to the madrassa in a way they didn't know. I went and sat in any class I found, studying their books and meeting these people, hoping I might find something. I didn't know what I was doing. On one hand, I was in love with a girl, slowly destroying myself by clinging to her presence and stinging my heart every day. On the other hand, I was destroying myself by wandering aimlessly. And then, one day, something happened, and my life shifted 360 degrees.
I was too scared, and my heart and brain felt like they had blown up. I cried the whole night that day. My family and I cried a lot. I thought everything was ending. I was so scared - too much. I didn't know what was going on. I saw everything as if time had stopped. I couldn't even blink my eyes. My eyes filled with tears, and streams of tears kept flowing without blinking. There was no sound, just my eyes moving up to the sky, and my heart said something. This process continued for hours.
From that day until now, I've only tried 0.0001% to know the truth about everything. I also feel so hurt by people's behavior, but I always pretend that I feel nothing. I always act rude with people. They think I have a stone heart. But in reality, I see them through my eyes, wondering if they get attached to me, and I leave, will they have to face the same things I faced? I don't want anyone to feel that intense shock. I've heard people say, "We've never seen a more stone-hearted person than you." After that, I went into ghost mode. I'm not on social media. How do I tell them what I know, and they don't?
